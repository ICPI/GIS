## About this Repository:

This repository is a living resource that introduces knowledge and practical skills needed to develop geospatial visualizations for HIV epidemic control. The repository sections include code, data, issues, and project management, as well as a wiki that organizes a wide array of resources for the PEPFAR GIS Community of Practice.

This page organizes code, tools, and tutorials centered on technical skills. Below are tutorials on QGIS, a widely used GIS software. **The tutorials found within this repository are meant to give users only the most basic geographic concepts. The purpose is to quickly facilitate the ability to use GIS in support of PEPFAR.**

*Users may contact ICPI for more information on anything contained withing this repository.*

## Commonly Asked Questions

Where can I find shapefile datasets?

* Reference shapefiles can be found on PEPFAR's [ArcGIS Online database](http://www.arcgis.com/home/group.html?id=03fd0317a7b54d6b9a52139ab3b51702#overview). There are two way to access these data. 1) Esri organizational account holders (e.g. through USAID or CDC) can request to join the PEPFAR AGOL Group. 2) PEPFAR GIS users may also request administrative unit boundaries that include DATIM uid in the attribute table directly from the GIS Cluster.

Where can I find health facility coordinates?

* Due to the sensitive nature of site level information, these datasets must be requested from the GIS cluster.

Where can I find UID information?

* UID information can be found in the attribute tables of PEPFAR shapefiles, the MSDs, or through DATIM. Access to uid codes for complete DATIM organization unit hierarchies may be found in the DATIM Data [Import and Exchange Resources](https://datim.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002334246-DATIM-Data-Import-and-Exchange-Resources) page under “Org Unit”.

<!-- ## How to Navigate this Repository.

This repo and its resources can be downloaded directly from Github for individual use. Each Chapter folder contains the chapter content, as well as any data and files referenced.

If you're an instructor using Canvas (or a similar LMS), and want to incorporate book materials directly into a course site, additional steps are necessary.

1. Download the workbook.
2. Convert Markdown files to HTML
    1. Each chapter contains one Markdown file with chapter content. To view this information in Canvas, it needs to first be converted to HTML.
    2. Use our [HTML-to-MD]() tool to convert each Markdown file.
3. Upload HTML to Canvas page
    1. Create a new page in Canvas.
    2. In the top right of the editor, select "HTML Editor"'.
    3. Copy the selected HTML file into the page.
4. Repair image links
    1. Upload all Chapter images (stored in an "img" folder in each Chapter) to Canvas.
    2. Now, each image will have its own URL on your canvas site.
    3. Replace the relative image links in the HTML with your new uploaded image links. -->
