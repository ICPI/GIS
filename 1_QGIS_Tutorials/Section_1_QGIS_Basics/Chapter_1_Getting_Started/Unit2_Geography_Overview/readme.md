# Unit 02: Geographic Concepts

## **What is Geography?**

It is the first question that must be answered before building a solid geospatial foundation. Simply put, geography is​:

> “The study of variations in phenomena from place to place.” ​– *Holt-Jensen*

>Geography is the study of places and the relationships between people and their environments…Geography seeks to understand where things are found, why they are there, and how they develop & change over time.” – *National Geographic​*

​Within geography are many disciplines. For our work in PEPFAR, this tutorial will focus on health based geography.

Health geography is a subdiscipline of human geography, with a vast body of literature. Health geography views health from a holistic perspective encompassing society and space, and it conceptualizes the role of place, location and geography in health, well-being and disease…”

With that in mind, what does health based geography look like in practice? See below for an example of an academic case study leveraging spatial data to answer complex analytical questions:

## **What is GIS?**

Now that you have a basic understand of geography, it's time to move onto 'GIS', otherwise known as:

> **G**eographic | **I**nformation | **S**ystems

A geographic information system (GIS) is a framework for capturing, managing, and analyzing spatial data. Rooted in the science of geography, GIS integrates many types of data. It analyzes spatial location and organizes layers of information into visualizations using maps and 3D scenes.

GIS applications are computer-based tools that allow the user to create interactive queries, store and edit spatial and non-spatial data, analyze spatial information output, and visually share the results of these operations by presenting them as geographic products.

In other words, GIS is an ***applied tool*** of geographers.

## Isn't GIS *just* a Map?

No. GIS is much more than a simple static map.
