# PEPFAR ICPI GIS CLUSTER

## _A repository containing **QGIS tutorials**, **geospatial scripts**, **web mapping examples**, organizational materials &amp; resources for the PEPFAR GIS community of practice_

---

## About this Repository:

***Please note that tools and tutorials are added every week and minor organizational shifting may occur.***

This repository is a living resource that introduces knowledge and practical skills needed to develop geospatial visualizations. Users can navigate through this database via the folders above, or the links below. Within the links below, you will find all the tools and tutorials seperated into three main categories.

Please refer to the **Recently Added** section for links to our latest releases.

Within the first category, [QGIS](/1_QGIS_Tutorials), you will find tutorials on both how to get started using the program, as well as a curated collection of common tools. **The tutorials found within this repository are meant to give users only the most basic geographic concepts. The purpose is to faciliate the ability to use of QGIS within PEPFAR in the quickest way. It should by no means be considered an extensive learning resource.**

In the second category, [geospatial tools](/2_Geospatial_Scripts), contains analysis tools written in both Python and R. To help with accesibility and quick use, many scripts will be provided in a pre-made format. Users may contact ICPI to request tools be translated into pyton or R, if they are not readily available.

The final category, [online mapping](/3_Web_Mapping), contains links to live examples of previously created web-based maps. Every map posted will have a code breakdown for users who would like to change the parameters to suit their specific needs.

*Users may contact ICPI for more information on anything contained withing this repository.*

## Commonly Asked Questions

Where can I find shapefile datasets?

* Currently shapefile data can only be found on PEPFAR's [ArcGIS Online database](link). Please note that you will need the approriate permissions to access this site. If you would like access, or want to request a OU specific administrative dataset, please contact the GIS cluster.

Where can I find health facility coordinates?

* Due to the sensitive nature of site level information, these datasets must be requested from the GIS cluster.

Where can I find UID information?

* UID information can be found within PEPFAR shapefiles, the MSDs, or through DATIM. More information on the DATIM heirachy can be found [HERE](link).

<!-- ## How to Navigate this Repository.

This repo and its resources can be downloaded directly from Github for individual use. Each Chapter folder contains the chapter content, as well as any data and files referenced.

If you're an instructor using Canvas (or a similar LMS), and want to incorporate  book materials directly into a course site, additional steps are necessary.

1. Download the workbook.
2. Convert Markdown files to HTML
    1. Each chapter contains one Markdown file with chapter content. To view this information in Canvas, it needs to first be converted to HTML.
    2. Use our [HTML-to-MD]() tool to convert each Markdown file.
3. Upload HTML to Canvas page
    1. Create a new page in Canvas.
    2. In the top right of the editor, select "HTML Editor"'.
    3. Copy the selected HTML file into the page.
4. Repair image links
    1. Upload all Chapter images (stored in an "img" folder in each Chapter) to Canvas.
    2. Now, each image will have its own URL on your canvas site.
    3. Replace the relative image links in the HTML with your new uploaded image links. -->
