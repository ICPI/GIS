## **Setting Up Your Training Workspace**

Before we get started, we must first create an area within your computer to store our geographic information.All downloaded materials will be stored in this folder. These datasets will be used to become familiar with the software, tools and accounts typically used within PEPFAR for mapping, reporting, and analytics.

## **STEP 1**

Create New Folder on *Desktop* or in an easily remembered location

## **STEP 2**

Name this folder: **Data Folder**â€‹

## **STEP 3**

Next, please download the geographic data needed for this tutorial using this [SharePoint Link](LINK). 

* Ensure that the data is saved within **Data Folder**
* If necessary, unzip the downloaded

For more information where to download PEPFAR geodata, please refer to the "Commonly Asked Questions" section on the [GIS Cluster homepage](https://github.com/ICPI/GIS).

For a refresher on data types, please see [Unit 4](https://github.com/ICPI/GIS/tree/master/1_QGIS_Tutorials/Section_1_QGIS_Basics/Chapter_1_Getting_Started/Unit4_Types_of_Data) of Chapter 1 within this tutorial.
